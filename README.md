A real-time chat application inspired by a social app. This project focuses on delivering a text messaging between users. It serves as a platform for learning and showcasing skills in full-stack development, real-time communication, and responsive design.

## Tech Stack:

-   **Frontend** - deployed on an **AWS** EC2 Linux instance.

    -   **React** - UI library for building user interfaces
    -   **Tailwind CSS** - CSS-in-JS for styling components
    -   **Recoil** - State management library
    -   **React Router** - Routing library for navigation
    -   **WebSockets (Socket.IO)** - Real-time communication (client)

-   **Backend** - deployed on a **Digital Ocean** CentOS instance.

    -   **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime
    -   **Express** - Framework for routing and middleware
    -   **MongoDB** - NoSQL database for storing user and message data
    -   **Mongoose** - MongoDB object modeling tool (schemas)
    -   **Socket.IO** - enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and server

## Features:

The projects offers:

-   [x] User authentication (`Sign Up`, `Sign In`, `Sign Out`)
-   [x] Real-time messaging with instant updates
-   [x] User status indicators (`online/offline`)
-   [ ] Message timestamps and read receipts
-   [x] Responsive design for mobile and desktop
-   [ ] Profile customization (`avatar upload`, `status message`)

## Backend Server Deployment

Backend server is hosted on a CentOS virtual machine (droplet) on the DigitalOcean platform. The server runs locally on the machine (localhost) and isn't directly accessible from the internet. To handle all client requests, i use **nginx** as a reverse proxy.

-   **nginx:**

    -   **Handles Incoming Traffic:** Listens for all web requests coming from the internet.
    -   **Forwards Requests:** It redirects these incoming requests to our backend server running on `localhost`.
    -   **Enhances Security:** Adds a layer of security to our endpoint routes. `localhost` packages are secured by SELinux, making them only accessible by **nginx.**

## API Endpoints

**`api`** `=` `chatterapi.hanifahmadov.site`

-   ### Authentication:

    -   [x] **POST** `api/signup` - Register a new user with optional avatar upload.

        -   **File Upload Handling:** - use `multer` middleware (`signup_multer.single("avatar")`) to handle single file upload under the field name avatar.

            > The uploaded file is saved to a publicly accessible images folder (served via `nginx`).

        -   **Password Hashing:** - uses bcrypt to hash the password with a predefined number of salt rounds (`bcryptSaltRounds`).

    -   [x] **POST** `api/signin` - Sign in a user and performing the following steps:

        -   **Credentials verification:** - Verifies that the provided `email` exists in the database and uses `bcrypt.compare` to validate the provided password against the stored hashed password.
        -   **Token Generation:** - Generates 2 `JWT` tokens:

            -   `access-token` `:` containing the user's ID and email, valid for 1 day, for signed user checks

            -   `refresh-token` `:` alid for 1 day or 7 days based on the  
                `remember` parameter, for secure cookies, when page reload auth.

    -   [x] **DELETE** `api/signout` - Sign out the user. This endpoint logs out the user by:

        -   **Clearing the JWT Cookie:** Removes the `jwt` cookie from the client's browser.

        -   **Invalidating the Access Token:** Sets the user's `accessToken` to `null` in the database.

        -   **Updating Last Seen:** Updates the user's `lastseen` timestamp to the current date and time.

            > Endpoint expects the user's `_id` in the request body.

    -   [ ] **POST** `api/change-pwd` - Change Password - `later`

-   ### Messaging:

    -   [x] **Send a Message:**

        -   **POST** `/api/messages/create`
        -   **Description:** Sends a message from the authenticated user to a recipient. Supports optional image upload and real-time notification to connected clients via Socket.IO.
        -   **Authentication:** Requires a valid access token.
        -   **Headers:** `Bearer <access_token>`
        -   **Body Parameters:**

            | `text`        | String   | Yes / No | The message content. Requirement depends on file if upload. |
            | `ownerId`     | ObjectId | Yes      | The user Id of the signed user.                             |
            | `recipientId` | ObjectId | Yes      | The user ID of the message recipient.                       |

            > If a file is uploaded, the message content is not required. Otherwise, the message content is required.

    -   [x] **Get all Messages**

        -   **GET** `/api/messages/read`
        -   **Description:** Retrieves all messages whenever a user signs in.
        -   **Response:** All db-retrieved messages have the `sender` and `recipient` fields populated. However, all sensitive fields are excluded from the response, such as `accessToken` and `hashedPassword`.

    -   [x] **Get Last Message and Unread Count**

        -   **GET** `/api/messages/:recipientId/last-message`
        -   **Description:** Retrieves the last message between the current `signed-in user` and a specified `recipient`, along with the count of `unread messages` from that recipient. This call happens when the user clicks the **`chats`** link, and it displays all users' chat history (last message between these users) and the recipient details.

    -   [x] **Mark Messages as Read**

        -   **POST** `/api/messages/:recipientId/mark-read`
        -   **Description:** All new messages are marked as `unread`, and these unread `popup-counts` stay active until the user reads these messages. Marking these new messages as `isRead`:`false` after the user sees these messages.

-   ### Page Reload

    -   [x] **Keep User Logged In**

        -   **GET** `/api/refreshAccess`
        -   **Description:** Refreshes the user's `access-token` using the refresh token stored in **`HTTP-only cookies`**. This endpoint allows a user to maintain an authenticated session upon page reload without requiring re-login.
        -   **Authentication** No `access-token` required, but a **valid** (`not expired`) refresh token must be present in **`cookies`**.

            > If successful, the user remains authenticated, and the application can continue without interruption.

            > If not(`token expired or missing`), the application should prompt the user to log in again.
